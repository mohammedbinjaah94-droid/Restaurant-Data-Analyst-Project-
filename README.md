# Restaurant Performance Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of a restaurant's operational data. The goal is to extract actionable insights to improve service efficiency, optimize staff performance, and enhance customer experience. The project workflow covers data cleaning with Python, database management with PostgreSQL, and in-depth analysis using advanced SQL queries.

##  Project Workflow

The project was executed in three main stages:

### 1\. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)

  - **Objective**: To prepare the raw dataset (`.csv`) for analysis by handling inconsistencies.
  - **Tools**: Python with the `pandas` library.
  - **Process**:
      - Loaded the raw data into a pandas DataFrame.
      - Inspected the data for missing values (`NaN`) and duplicates.
      - Handled missing `Total_Stay_Minutes` by filling them with `0`, as these corresponded to "Takeaway" orders.
      - Converted the `Total_Stay_Minutes` column to an integer type (`int`) to ensure compatibility with the database schema.
      - Saved the processed data into a new, clean file: `restaurant_data_cleaned.csv`.

### 2\. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

  - **Objective**: To create a structured database to host and query the cleaned data.
  - **Tools**: PostgreSQL and `pgAdmin`.
  - **Process**:
      - Created a new database named `restaurant_db`.
      - Defined a table schema named `orders` with appropriate data types for each column.
      - Used the `COPY` command to efficiently bulk-import the cleaned data from `restaurant_data_cleaned.csv` into the `orders` table.

### 3\. Data Analysis (SQL Queries)

  - **Objective**: To ask and answer critical business questions using SQL.
  - **Process**: A series of SQL queries, ranging from basic to advanced, were written and executed to uncover patterns related to operations, staff, customers, and menu items.
